# Estimation of protein solubility using PCA and neural networks

## Background
Estimation of protein solubility is of critical importance for biophysical research, protein chemistry, and drug design<sup>1</sup>. Testing solubility experimentally is both time and resource intensive, therefore it is not practicalâ€¦ Protein solubility depends on multiple biophysical parameters, including surface charge<sup>2</sup>,
